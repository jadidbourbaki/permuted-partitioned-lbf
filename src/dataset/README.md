The malicious URLs dataset was obtained from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sid321axn/malicious-urls-dataset?resource=download) and is in the public domain (Creative Commons CC0 License). We processed it by setting al "type" field of all non-benign URLs to "1" and all benign urls to "0". For faster testing, we also create a smaller dataset called `malicious_urls_tiny.csv`.
